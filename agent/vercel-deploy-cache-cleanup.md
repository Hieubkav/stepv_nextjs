# Vercel Build Cache Cleanup

- Vercel deploys were failing after the upload step because `.next/cache` ballooned to ~780â€¯MB, exceeding the platform's artifact limits.
- Updated `turbo.json` outputs to capture only the runtime artefacts (static files, server bundle, manifests) so cache data is excluded from remote caching.
- Added a `postbuild` script in `apps/web/package.json` that runs `node ./scripts/postbuild-cleanup.mjs` to remove `.next/cache` once `next build` finishes, ensuring the published bundle stays lightweight.
- Reuse this approach (trim cache + tighten Turbo outputs) whenever Next builds start producing oversized `.next` directories that cause Vercel uploads to error out.
