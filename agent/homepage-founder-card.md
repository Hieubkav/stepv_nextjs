# Homepage Founder Card

- Turning section founder block now renders the provided image via `<img>` instead of a background layer so the portrait stacks above the name text.
- Wrapper limits width to roughly 160px, keeps a square aspect, and adds a subtle border to match the black background.
- Use this pattern when swapping founder/leadership imagery so it stays vertically aligned with the title and scales cleanly on different data sets.
